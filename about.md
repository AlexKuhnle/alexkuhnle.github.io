- Established an alternative approach to a high-impact document processing project whose delivery was at risk.
- Continued development of Smart Vision (see below) and collaboration with engineering to productionise the prototype, resulting in the first Blue Prism Enterprise release to rely on a cloud-hosted ML service.
- Technical guidance, performance management and career development for the machine learning team.


**06/2021 – 08/2022** &nbsp; &nbsp; Lead ML Research Engineer at Blue Prism AI Labs (London, UK)

- Established product vision for a core product feature (now released as Smart Vision) to leverage computer vision models to understand desktop screens and enable users to automate GUI application workflows.
- Progressed the project from inception to the point of deploying a functional prototype to alpha customers.
- Project manager leading a team of 6 ML engineers: coordinating R&D roadmap and delivery, establishing working practice, providing technical guidance (certification: [AgilePM Foundation](https://www.credly.com/badges/66dc9376-74ec-40da-9ecc-f87a3a3b030d/public_url) & [Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/8e0eec39-ba7c-4e1b-a1f2-4c8082d39180/public_url).
- Hands-on contributor as well as technical product lead function, managing stakeholders across product management, architecture, engineering, legal, security, as well as presenting to senior management.
- Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Docker, microservices architecture, Azure DevOps.


**07/2019 – 05/2021** &nbsp; &nbsp; ML Research Engineer at Blue Prism AI Labs (London, UK)

- Worked on 3 research projects: program synthesis from demonstrations, optical character recognition dedicated to rendered fonts on screens, and computer vision applied to application GUIs.
- Independently designed, developed, and validated an improved OCR capability which has been integrated into the core product. Led stakeholder interactions, advised product engineering, and provided technical support.
- Drove academic engagement: based on a series of internal talks I gave, we organised a conference tutorial on [Reinforcement Learning for Information Retrieval](https://rl-starterpack.github.io/), presented 3x at SIGIR 2021, ECIR 2021, Search Solutions 2020.


**04/2018 – 06/2019** &nbsp; &nbsp; Machine Learning Lead, Core Team at Synthesized (London, UK)

- Led machine learning development at a start-up focusing on data simulation to address data inefficiencies.
- Designed the ML backend architecture and developed the generative models for highly semantic tabular data.
- Presented technical product vision and market differentiators to early customers, partners, and investors.



## Open-source experience

**04/2017 – 01/2022** &nbsp; &nbsp; [Tensorforce](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce)

- TensorFlow library for applied reinforcement learning, Github: 3,300 stars.
- One of the three creators of the framework and the sole maintainer of the framework since 2018.
- Designed the modular and flexible architecture of the framework as it is today.
- Managed the open-source community by actively supporting users with the application of the framework to their reinforcement learning use cases, which has led to longer-term research collaborations and publications.
