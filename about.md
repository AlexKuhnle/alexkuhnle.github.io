## Professional experience

**09/2022 – present** &nbsp; &nbsp; AI/ML Technical Lead at SS&C Blue Prism (London, UK)

- Technical AI leadership across the SS&C Blue Prism product portfolio.
- Management of machine learning projects from ideation through to delivery.
- Focus R&D activity on delivering iterative value and product differentiation.
- Drive collaboration with product management, architecture and engineering across product delivery lifecycle.
- Performance management and career development for the machine learning team.


**06/2021 – 08/2022** &nbsp; &nbsp; ML Project Lead at Blue Prism AI Labs (London, UK)

- Established technical vision and product strategy for an R&D project to leverage computer vision to understand desktop screens and enable users to automate GUI application workflows.
- Project manager leading a team of 6 researchers: coordinating R&D roadmap and delivery, establishing working practice, providing technical guidance (certification: [AgilePM Foundation](https://www.credly.com/badges/66dc9376-74ec-40da-9ecc-f87a3a3b030d/public_url) & [Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/8e0eec39-ba7c-4e1b-a1f2-4c8082d39180/public_url).
- Acted as R&D proxy-product-manager/owner, managing stakeholders across product management, architecture, engineering, legal, security, as well as presenting to senior management.
- Progressed the project from inception to the point of deploying a functional prototype to alpha customers for user testing and handing over development to engineering to productionise the prototype.


**07/2019 – 05/2021** &nbsp; &nbsp; Research Engineer at Blue Prism AI Labs (London, UK)

- Worked on 3 research projects: program synthesis from demonstrations, optical character recognition dedicated to rendered font on screens, and computer vision applied to application GUIs.
- Independently designed, developed, and validated an improved OCR capability which has been integrated into the core product. As part of that I led stakeholder interactions, advised product engineering on implementation considerations, and provided technical support.
- Drove academic engagement: based on a series of internal talks I gave, we organised a conference tutorial on [Reinforcement Learning for Information Retrieval](https://rl-starterpack.github.io/), presented 3x at SIGIR 2021, ECIR 2021, Search Solutions 2020.


**04/2018 – 06/2019** &nbsp; &nbsp; Machine Learning Lead, Core Team at Synthesized (London, UK)

- Led machine learning development at a start-up focusing on data simulation to address data inefficiencies.
- Designed the machine learning backend architecture of the MVP and developed the core generative models for highly semantic tabular data.
- Engaged with early customers, partners, and investors: delivering technical pitches, explaining technology and market differentiators, and presenting product vision.



## Open-source experience

**04/2017 – 01/2022** &nbsp; &nbsp; Lead developer of Tensorforce

- [Tensorforce](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce) is a TensorFlow library for applied reinforcement learning.
- One of the three creators of the framework and the sole maintainer of the framework since 2018.
- Designed the modular and flexible architecture of the framework as it is today.
- Managed the open-source community by actively supporting users with the application of the framework to their reinforcement learning use cases, which has led to longer-term research collaborations and publications.
