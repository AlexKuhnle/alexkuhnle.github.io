I am a research engineer at [Blue Prism AI Labs](https://www.blueprism.com/ai-labs/) where we use machine learning to enhance robotic process automation.

Moreover, I maintain and develop the open-source applied reinforcement learning framework [Tensorforce](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce).

I have recently finished my PhD at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) on *"[Evaluating visually grounded language capabilities using microworlds](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-942.html)"*, supervised by [Prof Ann Copestake](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aac10/). My dissertation has been highly commended as one of two runners-up in the UK-wide [CPHC/BCS Distinguished Dissertation Award 2020](https://www.bcs.org/more/about-us/press-office/press-releases/winner-of-the-cphcbcs-distinguished-dissertation-award-announced/).
